# 🧭 Travel Journal (React Project)

This is a simple, data-driven Travel Journal built as part of the **Ultimate React 101** course by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e:about).

## 🧠 What I Learned
- JSX & React Elements
- Creating Reusable Components
- Using Props to Pass Data
- Handling Static Assets (Images)
- Mapping Arrays to Components

## 🗂️ Structure
This is part of a larger practice repo where I build all six projects from the Scrimba course:

### Projects so far:
- 📄 **ReactFacts** — Static page for practicing JSX & components
- 🧭 **Travel Journal** — Data-driven app using props and mapping

More coming soon:
- 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude (React State)
- 🎭 Meme Generator (Side Effects)
- 🎲 Tenzies Game (Capstone 1)
- 🧩 Assembly: Endgame (Capstone 2)
